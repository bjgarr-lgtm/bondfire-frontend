# Quick Start (Crew)

1) Drop these files/folders into the repo root:
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/`

2) Use `ROADMAP.md` as the living checklist. Only add new lines; don't edit finished history.

3) When you ship something, add a dated line to `CHANGELOG.md` under the v3 section.

4) If you open issues, copy relevant checkboxes from ROADMAP.md into the issue body so they map 1:1.
